This is my first project while at Flatiron and I am fairly excited! This was an analysis on various parts of the movie industry. At the moment of writing this, I still consider myself fairly green, but I love what I'm learning so far!"

    "#### Why is this?\n",
    "Intuitively, these columns sound a lot more unique and distinct than something like action or adventure. Perhaps the people most inclined to watch these genres of movies, are ones that would be invested in watching. Also, with extra data, we could analyze how expectations of a certain genre affect the rating. For example, Horror movies are, on average, the lowest rated movie genre. People watch a horror movie expecting to get scared; if a movie does not meet the expectations of the viewers, it will receive a lower rating.\n",
    "### What genres have the highest Gross?\n",
    "I looked at worldwide gross average of the genres to see which genres were the highest performing. We found that the top 6 genres of movies with the highest gross are Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Action, Fantasy and Family. We looked at the both the mean and median for this. We used the median to account more accurately for any large outliers that may have been in our data.\n",

The data on this eventually did become skewed to the Malayalm cinema industry, and since the actors within that industry mostly do films in India and it appears very culturally-centric, I avoided considering them for this, since we would ideally want to reach a global audience with our films. The two actors I was able to find that fit my requirements were Mark Ruffalo and Andrew Garfield. I recommend we work with them. They are well liked in the films they have appeared in and their movies have been successful. Also, they are currently on a hot streak in terms of releasing, yet still are somewhat under the radar in terms of outright star power\n",
